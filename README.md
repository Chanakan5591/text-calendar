# Text Calendar

This is a simple rust program that will read a text file and then remind you of people's birthdays. 

You can tweak it to works for your own need.

It will remind you via a notification system of your Operating System. Sometimes Windows doesn't shows up notifications, that is not the problem of this software.

## Usage
Create a file named calendar.txt in your home directory (%USERPROFILE% on Windows, $HOME or ~/ on Unix/Linux).

The file format is something like so:

```
Chanakan: 16 April
Jourd: 2 May
```

to make this check every time you start the computer, simply put the exe file in the startup folder.

I will build a linux executable soon.
